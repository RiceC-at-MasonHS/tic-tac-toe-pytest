# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe (Terminal Edition) project!  
We want this to be a friendly, safe, and supportive place for everyoneâ€”especially beginners.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to:

- Be respectful and kind to each other.
- Help beginners and answer questions with patience.
- Give constructive feedback and encouragement.
- Assume good intentions from others.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being patient with questions and mistakes.
- Offering help to those who are learning.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks.
- Dismissing questions or making fun of mistakes.
- Using rude or offensive language.
- Any form of discrimination.

## Our Responsibilities

- Project maintainers (teachers and code owners) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

## Reporting Issues

If you see behavior that makes you or others feel unsafe or unwelcome, please contact a teacher or project maintainer privately.  
All reports will be handled respectfully and confidentially.

## Remember

Everyone was a beginner once.  
Be kind, be helpful, and have fun learning together!
