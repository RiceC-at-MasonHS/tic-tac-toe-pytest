# Contributing to Tic-Tac-Toe (Terminal Edition)

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is designed for learning, so all students are encouraged to participate.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository** or create a new branch for your work.
2. **Make your changes** on your branch.
3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to suggest your changes be merged into the main codebase.
4. **Wait for review:**  
   You cannot merge your own code. A teacher or designated reviewer will look at your PR, give feedback, and (if all is well) approve and merge it.

## Code Review & Code Owners

- All pull requests require review and approval by a code owner (the teacher or designated reviewers).
- You’ll see your PR marked as “awaiting review” until a code owner approves it.
- This process helps everyone learn how professional software teams work and keeps the main codebase stable.

## Tips for a Great Contribution

- Make sure your code is clear and well-commented.
- Run all tests before submitting your PR (`pytest`).
- If you’re not sure about something, ask in your PR or open an issue!
